# Projects

All notible programming projects completed by Anton Mogaddam and Muhammad Khan thus far.

# C Laboration 
This program allows for registration and handling of simple medications in the form of medication name, the size of the medication (ex. how many pills in a packet), and the inventory size of this specific medication. The program allows the user to save all data to file which can then be loaded into the program once restarted. All information about any specific medication can be changed or removed.

# Python DoorLock System (IoT Project)
Simpler project which tried to emulate a modern DoorLock system. Hardware that was used for this program was a RaspBerry Pi, Keypad, and magnetic sensor (to emulate closing and opening of door). A simple app was also made to test the database ability to identify the correct PIN-code.  

# Python Software for Password Generation
This was the project connected to our bachelors thesis. The goal of the bachelors project/thesis was to show that it was possible to have a software that can generate semi-random passwords that are secure yet still memorable to the user. The title of the thesis is "Developing a password generating software - Regaring password memorability and security" written by Anton Mogaddam and Muhammad Khan. Due to the neture of the project and the timeframe of said project the code is very messy and ugly, and was mainly done to obtain the desired functionality as fast as possible.

# Java Poker Squares
This program is ued to play a simple game of "Poker squares". The user has 5 cards in 5 different piles, different combo of cards (pair etc) gives a set amount of points.

# Java Sudoku Game
Complete Sudoku game programmed as a pair of 2 students. Functioning GUI for program was also made with "JavaFX".

# Quick learningpoints from our programming courses/projects in general
-After our first programming course in C, we learned how to actually write code, how code is executed and how different variables interact with eachother. We learned about writing and using functions and structs for more detailed definitions of "objects" that we create. This introduction to programming also learned us about simple algorithms that are used to ex. manipulate data in arrays.

-Our Python IoT project, although not perfect gave us an introduction of combining software with hardware. We learned to read simpler schematics and initialize and program the hardware we were using. We also learned how to setup a database for our program and how to send, receive and interpret the data that was sent/received.

-While the bachelor thesis project had its flaws it gave us an insight towards how data analytics is used and the usefullness in it, while also giving us an opportunity to learn more about the python language and reinforce our programming skills even further.

-The Java course really made us understand how to structure our code and program from an object-oriented view. The course taught us how to model our objects and follow design patterns which made it easier not only for ourselves, but also for other people to read and understand the code.
